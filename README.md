Introduction to React Native
React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that allows developers to
create mobile applications using JavaScript and React. Its primary advantage is the ability
to develop apps for both iOS and Android platforms from a single codebase, significantly
reducing development time and effort. This means you can write your application once and
deploy it on both platforms, taking advantage of native performance and user experience.
1.1 Key Features of React Native
• Cross-Platform Compatibility: Build applications that run seamlessly on both
iOS and Android.
• Hot Reloading: Instantly see the results of changes made to your code, speeding up
the development process.
• Rich Ecosystem: Access a wide range of libraries and components, making it easier
to add complex functionalities.
1.2 How React Native Works
React Native acts as a bridge between JavaScript and native code. When you write com-
ponents in React Native, they are translated into native components for iOS and Android.
This allows developers to leverage the performance and look of native apps while using
familiar JavaScript syntax.
1.3 Core Components of React Native
React Native provides a set of core components that are essential for building mobile ap-
plications. These components are pre-built and optimized for mobile devices. Below is an
expanded explanation of some of the most commonly used core components, along with
references to the official documentation.
• View: The core building block of the UI, similar to a <div> in HTML. It acts as a
container for other components.
• Text: Used to display text. Unlike in web applications, the Text component can style
its text independently of its container.
• TextInput: A core component for receiving text input from users, similar to an
<input> in HTML.
• ScrollView: Allows users to scroll through its content. Useful for lists or long content.
• StyleSheet: An abstraction similar to CSS, used to style components, allowing for
reusable styles and improved performance.
